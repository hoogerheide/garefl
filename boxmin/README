C fitting library for bounded derivative free fitting routines.

Code:

Makefile:       for compiling the library
amoeba.h:       for Nelder-Mead simplex with bounds constraints
amoeba.c:       implementation


Example code (in examples):

Makefile:       for compiling the test program
peaks.ic:       implementation of a matlab-like 'peaks' function
randmtzig.ic:   uniform and normal generator
test_amoeba.c:  driver for the amoeba fitter using 'peaks'

test_amoeba:    test program constructed when typing 'make'; run
		multiple times from random starting points; edit
		code to control for bounded/unbounded, etc.
bowl:           output from test program: 2D matrix of values in
		the neighbourhood of the minimum.
