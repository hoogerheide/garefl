<h2>GA refl</h2>

<p>Current version: @VERSION@  (<a href="release/garefl-@VERSION@-notes">release notes</a>)
 
<p>GA refl is a program for simultaneous fitting of X ray and neutron
polarized reflectometry data.  Slab models are supported, with interfacial
roughness.</p>

<p>A variety of fitting procedures are supported: genetic algorithms,
Nelder-Mead simplex and Levenberg-Marquardt.  All algorithms support
bounds constraints.</p>

<p>GA refl is a work in progress.  Preliminary versions of the program 
are available.</p>

<h2>Building from source</h2>

<p>Download the source for the current release
<a href="release/garefl-@VERSION@-src.tar.gz">garefl-@VERSION@-src.tar.gz</a>
or retrieve the current source from the repository:
<pre>
    svn co svn://danse.us/reflectometry/trunk/garefl
</pre>
</p>
     
<p>Building GA refl from source requires various text processing tools 
(e.g., sed) to configure the source, and C, C++ and Fortran compilers 
to build the executable.  You will need to install gnuplot to see the
results.
</p>

<p>Most unix systems will already have the required tools, though you
may need to install some of the development packages.</p>

<p>For Mac OS X the developers kit available in the install CDs contains
everything you need.  See your Apple documentation for details.
You will also need to find a version of fortran for your Mac.  Several
binaries for gfortran exist on the web.</p>

<p>On Windows it is easiest to install cygwin, being sure to select the
packages for the compilers (gcc, g++, gfortran) and for subversion (svn).
You can also use MinGW and MSYS.</p>


<p>Once you have the source downloaded and expanded, see the README file
for details.</p>
